Extremely Vicious Artifact
==========================

Description
------------

A simple but generic game engine, which uses OpenGL for rendering and invokes
SDL to perceive user events. It contains built-in UI Managment and game
physics. Hopefully, the engine will become cross-platform.

Architecture
------------

The overall architecture sketch can be found under `arch` directory.
